temperature (sensor)
– oxygen (sensor) 
(b) Any four from:
– information from the sensors sent to microprocessor
– the ADC converts the analogue data into digital form
– if temperature < 25ºC OR temperature checked against stored value
– ...microprocessor sends signal to heater/actuator/valve...
– ...to switch on heater
– if oxygen level < 20 ppm OR oxygen level checked against stored value
– ...to open valve/oxygen supply
– use of DAC between microprocessor and devices
– sounds an alarm if system unable to respond
– continuously monitors sensor inputs
– any reference to feedback 
(c) Any one from:
– unsafe limit stored in memory
– warning sound/signal if too high a value reached
– fail safe switch off in case of a malfunction
