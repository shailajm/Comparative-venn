temperature and heat sensor can be used. 
The sensor checks the level continously and send the information to the microprocessor.
The signal is converted using ADC. The temperature level is checked and compared.
Action is taken if the oxygen level is greater or lesser.
sounds an alarm for safe fail.
continously monitors the inputs and goes on till it is turned off.
